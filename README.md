## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a **virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory** using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

The purpose of the lab is to create a controlled environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security-testing activities can be performed safely and repeatedly.

The lab is configured on a private virtual network so that additional machines can be added later and used as targets for authorized security testing.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Install and configure VirtualBox.
- Install/import Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
- Create a private **NAT Network** for the cybersecurity lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Take a clean VM snapshot for recovery.
- Document the complete setup process.
- Prepare the environment for future cybersecurity projects.

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab

The lab provides an isolated and controlled environment for cybersecurity learning and authorized security testing.

It can be used for activities such as:

- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis
- Web security testing
- Exploitation practice
- Security-tool experimentation

⚠️ **Important:** This laboratory must only be used for systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems.

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.
